		<description>Convoke a highly directed psychic pulse towards the sky, tuned to humanlikes. The pulse disorients ship pilots by assaulting them with horrid voidsight visions, which can cause a shuttle crash. Shuttle crashes typically have at least a few survivors who are not affiliated with any faction, who you can capture for slavery or recruitment purposes, and the shuttle wreck can be deconstructed for resources.\nThere is also a chance for the visions to strike a fleet commander, causing them to engage in a space battle; space battles will cause dangerous shells to fall onto the area, as well as occasional drop pods and ship chunks.\nNaturally, psychic invasion of their pilots is not something that any faction will appreciate, and even those lacking in gravships or shuttles will feel the residual echoes of this ritual as they resonate in this world's atmosphere.</description>
