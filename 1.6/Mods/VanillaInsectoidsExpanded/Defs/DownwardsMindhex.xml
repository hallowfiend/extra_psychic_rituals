		<description>Convoke a highly directed psychic pulse into the depths of the earth, tuned to underground insectoids. The pulse drives the insectoids into a feeding frenzy, causing a hostile infestation.\nThe infestation can be cleared for insect meat, chitin and jelly; you could attempt to tame the insects; or they can act as a self-replenishing defense.\nDepending on ritual quality, the infestation has a chance to be twice the size it would've been otherwise.\nUnlike other mindhexes, this ritual has no diplomatic consequences, due to the direction of convocation.</description>

		<outcomeDescription>With the current ritual quality, the infestation has a {0} chance to double in size.</outcomeDescription>
